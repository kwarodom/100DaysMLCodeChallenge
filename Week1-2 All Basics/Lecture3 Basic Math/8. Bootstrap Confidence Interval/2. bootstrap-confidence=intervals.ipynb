By graphically displaying the bootstrap samples with an ECDF,\n","you can get a feel for how bootstrap sampling allows probabilistic descriptions of data.\n","\n","INSTRUCTIONS\n","\n","- Write a for loop to acquire 50 bootstrap samples of the rainfall data and plot their ECDF.\n","- Use np.random.choice() to generate a bootstrap sample from the NumPy array rainfall. Be sure that\n","the size of the resampled array is len(rainfall).\n","- Use the function ecdf() that you wrote in the prequel to this course to generate the x and y values\n","for the ECDF of the bootstrap sample bs_sample.\n","- Plot the ECDF values. Specify color='gray' (to make gray dots) and alpha=0.1 (to make them\n","semi-transparent, since we are overlaying so many) in addition to the marker='.' and linestyle='none'\n","keyword arguments.\n","- Use ecdf() to generate x and y values for the ECDF of the original rainfall data available in the\n","array rainfall.\n","- Plot the ECDF values of the original data.\n","Hit 'Submit Answer' to visualize the samples!"]},{"metadata":{"id":"DVwtz5YI_Ak7","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["def ecdf(data):\n","    \"\"\"Compute ECDF for a one-dimensional array of measurements.\"\"\"\n","\n","    # Number of data points: n\n","    n = len(data)\n","\n","    # x-data for the ECDF: x\n","    x = np.sort(data)\n","\n","    # y-data for the ECDF: y\n","    y = np.arange(1, n+1) / n\n","\n","    return x, y\n","\n","rainfall = np.array([   875.5,   648.2,   788.1,   940.3,   491.1,   743.5,   730.1,\n","                        686.5,   878.8,   865.6,   654.9,   831.5,   798.1,   681.8,\n","                        743.8,   689.1,   752.1,   837.2,   710.6,   749.2,   967.1,\n","                        701.2,   619. ,   747.6,   803.4,   645.6,   804.1,   787.4,\n","                        646.8,   997.1,   774. ,   734.5,   835. ,   840.7,   659.6,\n","                        828.3,   909.7,   856.9,   578.3,   904.2,   883.9,   740.1,\n","                        773.9,   741.4,   866.8,   871.1,   712.5,   919.2,   927.9,\n","                        809.4,   633.8,   626.8,   871.3,   774.3,   898.8,   789.6,\n","                        936.3,   765.4,   882.1,   681.1,   661.3,   847.9,   683.9,\n","                        985.7,   771.1,   736.6,   713.2,   774.5,   937.7,   694.5,\n","                        598.2,   983.8,   700.2,   901.3,   733.5,   964.4,   609.3,\n","                        1035.2,   718. ,   688.6,   736.8,   643.3,  1038.5,   969. ,\n","                        802.7,   876.6,   944.7,   786.6,   770.4,   808.6,   761.3,\n","                        774.2,   559.3,   674.2,   883.6,   823.9,   960.4,   877.8,\n","                        940.6,   831.8,   906.2,   866.5,   674.1,   998.1,   789.3,\n","                        915. ,   737.1,   763. ,   666.7,   824.5,   913.8,   905.1,\n","                        667.8,   747.4,   784.7,   925.4,   880.2,  1086.9,   764.4,\n","                        1050.1,   595.2,   855.2,   726.9,   785.2,   948.8,   970.6,\n","                        896. ,   618.4,   572.4,  1146.4,   728.2,   864.2,   793. ])"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"-KGLoH_EXEwB","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["for _ in range(50):\n","    # Generate bootstrap sample: bs_sample\n","    bs_sample = np.random.choice(rainfall, size=len(rainfall))\n","\n","    # Compute and plot ECDF from bootstrap sample\n","    x, y = ecdf(bs_sample)\n","    _ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none',\n","                 color='gray', alpha=0.1)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"sKqBvmHFXEu2","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Compute and plot ECDF from original data\n","x, y = ecdf(rainfall)\n","_ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.')\n","\n","# Make margins and label axes\n","plt.margins(0.02)\n","_ = plt.xlabel('yearly rainfall (mm)')\n","_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')\n","\n","# Show the plot\n","plt.show()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"4gzSURnQXEty","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"u6oyBKM5XEsU","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
